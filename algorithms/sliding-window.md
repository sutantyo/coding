# Sliding Window

Sliding window is a general-problem solving technique when we solve the problem by looking at part of the data at a time. It is probably best explained using an example; suppose that we are given an array

`[  8 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 11 , 9 ]`

and we are asked to find largest sum of 5 consecutive integers, which should be the subarray `[ 11 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 11 ]`. &#x20;
